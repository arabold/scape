### Overview
This is yet a very rough version of what to come... 

_scape_ allows you to create responsive emails directly in your browser and
shows you a preview for desktop and mobile devices in realtime, while you type.

_scape_ is based on the popular responsive email boilplate Ink by ZURB (zurb.com/ink/) and based on Node.js, Express, AngularJS, Bootstrap and CodeMirror.

### Setup
_scape_ uses `npm` for package management and installation so setup is quite easy and straight forward:
```
npm install
npm start
```

_scape_ is based on the [LEAN Boilerplate](https://github.com/arabold/lean-boilerplate) and developed alongside.

### Deploy to Heroku
To deploy _scape_ to Heroku, simply create a new app and use git to push it up:
```
git push heroku master
```
